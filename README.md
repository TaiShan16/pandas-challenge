# pandas-challenge

The goal of this project is to create and manipulate Pandas DataFrames to analyze school and standardized test data.
This project will help the City's school district and the school board in making strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

There are 2 datasets provided in csv format. One is students_complete.csv, and another one is school_complete.csv. The tasks here are to combine these 2 dataset and analyze the district-wide standardized test results of math and reading, then aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.
